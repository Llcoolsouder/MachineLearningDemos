# Machine Learning Demos

This repository contains code demos for various topics in machine learning as presented in Dr. Polikar's Machine Learning Clinic at Rowan University.

Most algorithms have been implemented once by hand for a simple, randomly generated dataset and demonstrated on more complex, real-world datasets using prewritten libraries. Here you will find code for:

* Bayes Classifier
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Multinomial Logistic Regression
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Perceptron
* Feed Forward Neural Network
* Support Vector Machine *(coming soon)*

All code is written and tested by Lonnie L. Souder II
